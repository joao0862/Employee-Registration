### Description

  Two small Java language training projects, from Caelum's workbook, 
with the aim of creating employee records at a university and a commercial company.
In "Trade", there are three distinct classes: "Funcionario" (General attributes of registration), 
"Gerente" (Particular attributes of the position) and "Controle" (Bonus analysis). In "College", 
two classes were created: "Empregado_faculdade" (General attributes) and "Professor" (Private attributes). 
In both files, the concept of Inheritance and Polymorphism was used.
